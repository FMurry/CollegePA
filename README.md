# CollegePA
Welcome to the College Planner Assistant app! This app is a Tasking app for college students. You will be able to add classes and     assignments. Essentially this is a digital planner

<h1>Installition</h1>
<br>
There is multiple ways to get this working. Installing the app_debug.apk with your emulator/mobile device. This app contains private keys so I'd prefer it to be done this way. Once you clone the repository you will see an .apk file  under the main directory for the app. Start your emulator that you would like to use (Recommended API 22 and up). In android studio you can run the command "adb install app-debug.apk" this will install the apk for you. Display all of your apps and look for the app called CollegePA.
<br>
Make sure that android's adb has been added to the PATH of your machine, whether that's Windows, Mac, or Linux.
<br>
Alternatively you can just run the app from android studio. Beware that doing this may result in google login not working.

<h1>How to Use</h1>
<br>
When you first boo the application you will be at the login screen. Here you have 3 login types, FaceBook, Google, and email/password. A week after grades are turned in I will purge all accounts so don't worry about me keeping data for any of these authentication methods.


<h1>Goal of this Project</h1>
<br>
The goal of this project is to test out google's firebase api and to store data in the cloud rather than on the device itself (App will save data offline to!). I wanted to make a simple app that can keep track of your assignments with (Mainly for classes that don't use canvas, I have a few of them). Some possibilities(not yet implemented features) I see with this app are:
<ul>
	<li>
	Using the app alongside canvas with canvas API. Student logs in with canvas and their classes are populated automatically
	</li>
	<li>
	Use the drive api so user can store notes, photos with their classes
	</li>
</ul>

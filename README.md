# CollegePA
Welcome to the College Planner Assistant app! This app is a Tasking app for college students. You will be able to add classes and     assignments. Essentially this is a digital planner

There is multiple ways to get this working. Installing the app_debug.apk with your emulator/mobile device. This app contains private keys so I'd prefer it to be done this way. Once you clone the repository you will see an .apk file  under app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk. Start your emulator that you would like to use (Recommended API 22 and up). In android studio you can run the command "adb install app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk" this will install the apk for you. Display all of your apps and look for the app called CollegePA.
